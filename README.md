### Making Changes
If you want to make changes to the website, make a new branch to make your changes on. 

Deploying:

1. Make a Pull Request to merge your branch with master.

! If you just edited markdown and dont want to rebuild the site, add ```[skip ci]``` to the commit message.!

2. Post the Pull Request URL to #pull-requests channel in discord and ask someone to review your changes.

3. When your changes are approved, merge the Pull request to master and it will deploy your changes to the website :).
